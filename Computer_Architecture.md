How Computers work : whats makes a computer a computer
it wolud need to take input ,store information ,process it and the end output (result)
input ,  can tell the  computers what to do with the keyboard, your mouse ,camera ..
these all input give a  computer information computer proccessor take information from memory it changes it using algorithm
and it send to processed information back to be srored in memory again this continues until the processed information is ready to be output

How Computers work : Binary & Data 
you may have heard that computers work on ones and zeros, but almost nobody today actually deals directly with these ones and zeros
but ones and zeros do play a big role in how computers work on the inside
`The Binary Number System`
in the decimal number system, we have ten digits from zeroto nine, in binary number system ,we only have two difits : zero and one 
with these two digits we can count up to any number
but what about other types of information ? like (Text,image , sound) it turns out that all these things can also be represented with number
Every wrod you see om every  webpage or your phone is represented using a system like this
lets consider photos , videos and all the graphics you see on a sereen,all of these images are made out of teeny dots calles `pixels`
and of the colors can be represented withe numbers

How Computers work : circuits & logic 
every input or output of a computer is effectively a type of information, which can be represented by on or off electrical signals
or ones and zeros.
in this exapmple a circuit will take two electrical singles ,now each one might be 1 or 0,if either of the signal coming in is a 0 then the result is also a 0
This circuit will only give you a 1
if the first signal and ara both a 1, and so we call the circuit and
