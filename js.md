## Secript :

What is ascript and how do i create one ?

A SCRIPT IS A SERIES OF INSTRUCTIONS

A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal.

You could compare scripts to any of the following

1- RECIPES

2- HANDBOOKS

3- MANUALS

EXPRESSIONS
An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking there are two types of expressions.

1- EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A VALUE TO A VARIABLE

2- EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR MORE VALUES TO RETURN A SINGLE VALUE

OPERATORS

Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers 
to create a single value from one or more values
ARITHMETI C OPERATORS :
Ex :

ADDITION `+`  Adds one value to another
SUBTRACTION  `-`  Subtracts one value from another
DIVISION `/` Divides two values



WHAT IS A FUNCTION?

Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. 
If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements).

FUNCTION : is very helpfull it's has many benefits
- avoid duplicated
- and it's reusable (created ones and use it many times)
