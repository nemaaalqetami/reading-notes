## Comparison operators Evaluating conditions :

And : this operator tests more than one condition.

OR :this  operator tests at least one condition.

Equals `==` : this operator compares two values(numbers , strings , booleans ) to see if they are the same


`<` : less than ,this operator checks if the number on the left is less than the number on the right



## Loops 
Loops check a condition ,if it return true .
Ex for Loops 
 
 `FOR` it's more common than authors ,if you need to run code a specific number of times .
 `WHILE` if you do not know how many times the code should run.
 `DO WHILE` is very similar to the while loop.
 
the for structure
`for (initial value ;condition; updating statment )`
`{
statments

}`

the while structure 
`while(condition)`
`{

statments


}`
